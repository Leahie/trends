Idea: Amping up my personal website! 
Goals: 
1. Display all projects 
2. Use Rest apis with "open library" to let users see my current reading list. 
3. Make a fun front end animation for the home page and logo.

NEW IDEA!! Decided that the first idea wouldn't be able to support a firebase website. For milestone 1 I mainly focused on creating the API routes. Currently the actually frontend is very minimal. I'm on the plane right now so I don't even know if it works, but it will be fleshed out by the next milestone.

Idea: Photo App 
Goals: 
1. 3 pages, first the gallery tab, second the add tab, third the additional information tab 
2. use firebase to add and remove the images 
3. create a nicely styled app! 
4. have a tab that switches the order of the images, good application to actual products 
 - sort by alphabetical order
 - sort by date last added
